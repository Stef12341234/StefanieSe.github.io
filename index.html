    <h1><strong>Chicken time</strong></h1>

    <h2>Worldwide there are...</h2>
    
    <p><strong> more than 2.000</strong> different chicken breeds. 
        You probably only know the common brown or white chicken on 
        your egg box. However, these are actually hybride chickens. 
        Meaning they are a mix out of many different breeds made to bring 
        the maximum amount of eggs. These chickens actually lay so many eggs that after their
        laying period they are so used out that they can not even be used for their meat anymore.
        Due to their high egg production and faster growth they can not probperly build out 
        their bones and are constantly missing vitamins. 
        Therefore many organic farmers go back to using older breeds that can be used for eggs 
        as well as for meat.

    <p>One of the breeds that was breeded into the hybride chickens is the New Hampshire chicken.
        They lay about 220 eggs in their first year and look very similar to the brown
        chickens that we may be familiar with.
        The Dutch kind of this breed however has dark tail feathers and some dark around their necks and wings

        </p>Another chicken breed that i would like to mention is the Wyandotte chicken. 
    Their face looks a bit different than the 'common' chickens in that they do not have a big comb and
    their face is very red with little feathers. Their feather coloring can go from one color 
    to two colors sprinkled in black and white or different browns with white or black.
    They are very peaceful, social and talkative.
